## Typescript Definitions for Pixi.js v4

The recommended install is from DefinitelyTyped using:

`npm install @types/pixi.js --save-dev`

This repository contains the most recent version of the declarations for pixi.js and follows the [dev branch](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/tree/dev) with periodical [Releases](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-typescript/releases) which are supposed to match pixi releases by the core team.

Each release is pushed to DefinitelyTyped.

Any advice, suggestions or improvements would be appreciated.
