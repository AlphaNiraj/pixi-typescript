## Typescript Pixi.js v4.2.2 bunnies test ##

WIP

Test compilation with "tsc"

Currently SystemRenderer.ts is a problem - it breaks everything when I try to include eventemitter3
Also we have to somehow use object-assign

Files that have to be rewritten before first demo are in "tmp" folder

Pixify has some problems too
